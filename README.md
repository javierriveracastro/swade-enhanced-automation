# Swade enhanced automation

This is a experimental module trying to add new automation options to Foundry SWADE system while working with the default behaviour. Instead of rewriting the built-in automation it tries to improve upon it, keeping system UI as untouched as possible.

## Features

* Gang-up: It adds basic gangup resolution to the system modifiers. It is based in BR2 gangup calculation, so it should be quite robust and tested. It doesn't support all the BR features.
* Scale: Adds scale modifiers.
* Armor minimum strength over character strength.
* Target is vulnerable or stunned.
* Shooting weapons with higher minimum strength than the character
